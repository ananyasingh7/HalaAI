Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science and mathematics where a function calls itself repeatedly until it reaches a base case, which is a condition that stops the recursion.

That final point where you can't fold it anymore is like the base case in recursion.\n\nIn the context of Ananya's interests, you could think of recursion as playing a sport where each game you win leads you to play another game, until you reach a point where you can't play anymore, like the end of a season or a tournament.

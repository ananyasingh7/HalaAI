4,2025-12-27 01:34:27.961251,unknown,base,Write me recursive python3 Fibonacci sequence ,,"Certainly! Here's a simple recursive function to generate Fibonacci numbers in Python:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return ""Input should be a positive integer""
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Example usage:
n = 10
for i in range(1, n+1):
    print(f""Fibonacci({i}) = {fibonacci(i)}"")
```

This code defines a function `fibonacci(n)` which returns the n-th Fibonacci number. Note that the Fibonacci sequence is typically defined as starting with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. The recursion in the function `fibonacci(n)` correctly reflects this definition.

However, please be aware that this recursive approach has exponential time complexity (O(2^n)) due to the repeated calculations of the same Fibonacci numbers. For larger values of `n`, it would be more efficient to use iterative methods or memoization to store previously computed values.",37,236,6.11681818962097,38.5821505043987,mlx-community/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-4bit,0.7,789.5,19.0,0.0,74.2,0.0240725059509277
